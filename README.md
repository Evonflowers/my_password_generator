# Password Generator

## Repository

As hackers continue to breach private information, it's important to make your passwords unique and difficult to break. It's important that you don't use common phrases and public information, such as previous addresses. This password generator will ask you for the desired number of characters, and you can choose to include any of the following:

<ul>
  <li>Numbers</li>
  <li>Uppercase Letters</li>
  <li>Lowercase Letters</li>
  <li>Special Characters</li>
</ul>

Below I'll include a screenshot of what the page looks like, with my newly generated password shown as an example.
